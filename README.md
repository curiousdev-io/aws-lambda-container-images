# aws-lambda-container-images

This repository supports the [AWS Lambda Container Images](aws-lambda-container-images) blog post. We will look at mechanisms to build out containerized Lambda functions using several options:

* [AWS base image for Lambda](./aws-base-images/README.md)

The project is self-contained; each example can be run independently.
